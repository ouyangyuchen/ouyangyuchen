Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm (James) Yuchen Ouyang, a senior undergraduate student
major in Information Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
I am applying ECE/CS master programs in US and Switzerland for 2024 Fall admission.

I hope to become a software design and architecture engineer in the future,
and then implement a platform to visualize many subjects
(literacy, history, geography, ...) into graphic form to serve as *visual library*.

As a self-driven student who is passionate about software systems,
I have studied many high-quality online courses and finished the lab assignments
with almost 100% grades. You can see my answers and notes in the corresponding repositories.
